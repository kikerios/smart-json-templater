## rules.json (Using JSONPath Syntax)

    save: 'title', // save the result in this key

### JSONPath Syntax

JSONPath         | Description
-----------------|------------
`$`               | The root object/element
`@`                | The current object/element
`.`                | Child member operator
`..`	         | Recursive descendant operator; JSONPath borrows this syntax from E4X
`*`	         | Wildcard matching all objects/elements regardless their names
`\[\]`	         | Subscript operator
`\[,\]`	         | Union operator for alternate names or array indices as a set
`\[start:end:step\]` | Array slice operator borrowed from ES4 / Python
`?()`              | Applies a filter (script) expression via static evaluation
`()`	         | Script expression via static evaluation

Here are syntax and examples [JSONPath.md](https://github.com/kikerios/smart-json-templater/blob/master/JSONPath.md)


## template
```
The template must be a String
const template = '{{~}}' // special key

or a JSON
const template = {
	public: '{{title}} by "{{author}}", only for USD {{price}}',
	library: '{{address}}',
}

```
### Special Keys

Key| Description
-----------------|------------
`{{~}}`               | Attach transformed data
`{{$}}`                | Attach original data / request

## example #1
```
const templater = require('smart-json-templater')

// example data
const template = '{{~}}'
const rules = require('./rules.json')
const raw = require('./raw.json')

templater
	.convert(template, rules, raw)
	.then((result)=>{
			console.log(result)
	})
```
## result #1
