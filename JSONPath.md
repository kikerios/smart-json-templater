## JSONPath Syntax

JSONPath         | Description
-----------------|------------
`$`               | The root object/element
`@`                | The current object/element
`.`                | Child member operator
`..`	         | Recursive descendant operator; JSONPath borrows this syntax from E4X
`*`	         | Wildcard matching all objects/elements regardless their names
`[]`	         | Subscript operator
`[,]`	         | Union operator for alternate names or array indices as a set
`[start:end:step]` | Array slice operator borrowed from ES4 / Python
`?()`              | Applies a filter (script) expression via static evaluation
`()`	         | Script expression via static evaluation 

Given this sample data set, see example expressions below:

```javascript
{
  "store": {
    "book": [ 
      {
        "category": "reference",
        "author": "Nigel Rees",
        "title": "Sayings of the Century",
        "price": 8.95
      }, {
        "category": "fiction",
        "author": "Evelyn Waugh",
        "title": "Sword of Honour",

      }
    ],
    "bicycle": {
      "color": "red",
      "price": 19.95
    }
  }
}
